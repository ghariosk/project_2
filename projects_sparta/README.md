# Project 2

## Visitors
A visitor can enter the web application without having to sign in or creating a user account, although visitors may create accounts if they wish to. Visitors can view previous Sparta Global Trainee projects from tiles that are neatly displayed on the homepage.

## Creating a user account
Visitors are required to fill in a short sign-up form which takes an email address, password confirmations and the user's full name.

## Login Users
Once a user has created a log-in account they are given direct access to creating new projects. New project tiles take the project's name, a short description of the project and an image and GitHub url. They are also required to attach the project file. The created project will then appear on the homepage, and can be viewed in the user's personal projects page.
