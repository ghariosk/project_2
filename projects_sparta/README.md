# Project 2

## Functionality

### Getting Started

### Log In
When a user logs in, they can create their own projects, as well as editing and deleting them from the application. An admin user has full control over the application.

### Header Navigation Bar

The user can navigation to the homepage and public projects in a normal visitor mode. Users who are logged in can have access to their personal projects, as well as creating, viewing and deleting project tiles from the application. An admin user will have access to the user log, which allows project approval and user control (including setting users to admin).

### Footer Navigation Bar

The user can navigate to the official Sparta Global website and to the Sparta Global Contact forms, which enable users to request a contact from client at Sparta Global.
