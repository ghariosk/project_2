# Project 2

A project system for Sparta Global.

## Functionality and Services

### Getting Started

When first entering the web application, the user is greeted by a display of previous projects that trainee consultants at Sparta Global have undertaken. The user is able to manoeuvre through two navigation bars; one placed at the top of the page and one at the bottom.

### Log In
When a user logs in, they can create their own projects, as well as editing and deleting them from the application. An admin user has full control over the application.

### Header Navigation Bar

The user can navigation to the homepage and public projects in a normal visitor mode. Users who are logged in can have access to their personal projects, as well as creating, viewing and deleting project tiles from the application. An admin user will have access to the user log, which allows project approval and user control (including setting users to admin).

## Implementation

The project was developed using a wide range of Ruby on Rails functions with the addition of Bootstrap. CSS, HTML on Rails and JQuery were also implemented into the design.
